# cljs-audio-experiments

Of course I haven't packaged this thing properly. It features, among other gimmicks:

* A volume mixer for PulseAudio, controlled by a Midi Fighter Twister.
* A Monome-like sample-slicing controller for a C audio sampler I wrote, controlled by a Novation Launchpad Mini.

Yeah, I'm one of _those_ people. Both experiments were good fun --
especially when I came across this "ambient noise" website which
happened to run 16 separately controllable audio streams out of Firefox.
